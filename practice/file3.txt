Sequel
The film's post-credits scene teases a sequel titled Animal Park, which was confirmed in December 2023 by Vanga.[140] Shortly after the film's release, Vanga said the sequel would be "darker" and "meaner" than its predecessor.[141] In an interview, Kapoor revealed Vanga had prepared and narrated a few scenes for the sequel to him.[142]

In 2024, Vanga revealed that the shooting will commence in 2026.[143] Saurabh Sachdeva, who played Abid in the film, similarly revealed that the sequel could begin filming in 2026 or 2027 due to both Vanga and Kapoor being busy with their respective projects, Spirit and Ramayana.[144]
